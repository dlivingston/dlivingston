## Web Developer, UI Designer, and Digital Craftsman

I’m a Studio Senior Frontend Developer at [Deloitte Digital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deloitte-digital/mycompany/). I currently reside amongst the verdant hills of New Jersey, and can periodically be found in and around the New York Metro area. I’m a huge Technology & Science Geek and my love for learning and finding out how things work borders on the obsessive.

I’ve been a professional Front-End Web Developer and Interface Designer for over 12 years. I am a Digital Craftsman who creates clean, readable, maintainable code, as well as attractive and usable web designs. My personal aptitude is in balancing the “right-brained” creative concerns of User Interface Design with the “left-brained” logical and analytic discipline of Development.
